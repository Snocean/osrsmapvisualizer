# OSRS Map Visualizer
## Basic map program with ability to set pins on the map and show/hide them through checkboxes

### Usage
You can either build the program from the .py file yourself or just download the executable in the release folder. Running the file requires the "worldmap.png" to be in the same folder as the .exe
You can modify the worldmap.png as you would any picture (if you want to add your own teleport markers/larger city texts for easier visibility, or use it for a completely different game)
Type the name of the pin, hit add and the default color is yellow, you can click the square beside the new line to change the pins color or right click the new line to remove it
