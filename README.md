# OSRS Map Visualizer
## Basic map program with ability to set pins on the map and show/hide them through checkboxes

### Getting it running
- You can either build the program from the .py file yourself or just download the executable in the release folder. Running the file requires the "worldmap.png" to be in the same folder as the .exe

- You can modify the worldmap.png as you would any picture (if you want to add your own teleport markers/larger city texts for easier visibility, or use it for a completely different game). I've included the original size worldmap in the release folder as well but this is not needed for the program to run, only worldmap.png

### Usage
- Figure out the type of pin you want to make and it's location (Hardwood Tree farming patch on Fossil Island)
- Type the name of the pin, hit add and it will add a pin to the map towards the top left.
- Drag the pin to the location on the map that you want it to be after naming it (Hardwood tree patch on fossil island as an example)
- Change the color of the pin by clicking on the color square by the new line on the left
- Right click and "Remove" to delete a pin

### Default pins
- I've included my own default pins that I setup for the Tree/Fruit tree/Hardwood tree/Herb/Flower/Allotment patches that **I currently have available** but you can add/remove pins to meet your own needs

### Current issues/bugs
- When opening the program the pins might be out of place from the last time you closed/opened the program, I noticed this happen more often when I full screen the program, close the program, then re-open the program and it defaults to a windowed view instead of full screen. **If you maximize and then set it back to windowed mode I found this fixes it for me**
- The program window is called "OSRS Farming Points" because that's what I was using it for and I'll change it if I re-build the executable at some point but for now I don't care
- Probably lots of other bugs, this was a quick wip with chatGPT
